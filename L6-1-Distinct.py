# Task description
# Write a function

# def solution(A)

# that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

# For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:

#  A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
#  A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
# the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

def solution(A):
    # write your code in Python 3.6
    # pass
    if len(A)==0:
        return 0
    A.sort()
    ans=1
    for i in range(1,len(A)):
        if A[i]!=A[i-1]:
            ans+=1
    return ans
