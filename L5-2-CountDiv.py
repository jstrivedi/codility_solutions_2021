# Write a function:

# def solution(A, B, K)

# that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

# { i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }

# For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
# K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
# A ≤ B.

def solution(A, B, K):
    # write your code in Python 3.6
    # pass
    amod = A%K
    bmod = B%K
    b = B-bmod
    a = A-amod+K
    if amod ==0:
        return int(b/K-a/K+2)
    return int(b/K-a/K+1)
